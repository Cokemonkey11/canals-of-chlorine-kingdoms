## Foundations

- 30-40 minute game time
- a fed carry should be able to 1v5
- a fed carry should be able to few-shot other carries and casters
- the game is closer to chess in the sense that the carry is the queen and everyone else's job is to prepare the queen to ace
- each player is either a carry, a caster, or a tank. casters and tanks are both kinds of support. carries are ranged. casters are ranged. tanks are melee. bruisers and fighters are kinds of tank.
- there are no melee assassins. there is no invisibility. there is no long-lasting mirror image. there are no random crits.
- KISS and YAGNI


## Design decisions

- looking for alternatives to neutral creeps for create team fights
- would like to have some way for new players to be relevant. For now, that means classic wc3 heroes are supported
- First power spike item at 1000g is significant:
    Essence reaver
    Giant slayer
    Bloodthirster
    Blade of the ruined king
    Lord Dominiks regards
    Edge of night

    Warmogs
    Banshees veil
    Deaths dance
    Sunfire aegis
    Spirit visage
    Guardian angel

    Lich Bane
    Rod of ages
    Morellonomicon
    Rabadons deathcap
    Landry's torment
    Void staff
