Tyro is a hybrid melee support champion, who is designed to excel in duo-lanes and team fights, but can deal significant damage at the right time.

Visually, Tyro is a large and muscular being whose age is contrary to his gait. Once an incarnation of war, today his limited energy encourages him to focus his resolve on teaching others the true meaning of wrath.

**Innate**: Strategic Vision: Passive: While not in combat for 5 or more seconds, Tyro's sight radius increases by 50%.

* **Q**: Battle Mirror: [Switch, Instant Cast, Medium Cooldown, Medium Mana Cost]

Battle Mirror is a switching ability which can be toggled on and off. When enabled, Tyro converts (70,80,90,100,110)% of his ability power to attack damage. In this stance, Tyro's ability power is reduced to zero temporarily and all other abilities are disabled. Tyro also gains unit-walking (can walk through units and champions without collision).

Visually, Tyro's arms should glow white, and enemies struck in this state should cause an echoing sound.

* **W**: Escalating Will: [Active, Target Projectile Cast, Medium Cooldown, Medium Mana Cost]

Escalating Will applies a buff to a target ally which, when enabled, causes any damage dealt to Tyro or his ally to increase his ally's attackspeed by (1,2,3,4,5)%, stacking indefinitely. The effect lasts for (5,6,7,8,9) seconds.

Visually, Escalating Will should create a white orb at each member of the interaction which moves over a narrow ellipse towards the other. The effect begins when the orb reaches its destination, implying the effect can begin and last longer if the two begin closer together.

* **E**: Paralysis Bomb: [Semi-Channeling, Target Mousecursor, Medium Cooldown, Low Mana Cost]

When Paralysis Bomb is activated, an orb begins firing from Tyro's position towards the user's cursor. While the orb doesn't meet a target or extend past its maximum range, Tyro continues channeling and the orb will attempt to meet his controller's cursor. Paralysis bombs are initially slow moving, but accelerate over their duration and are affected by reduced user control as their velocity increases.

If a paralysis bomb meets its target, the enemy is affected with a 1 second slow by (50,60,70,80,90)%.

Visually, Tyro should have a unique animation for the channeling of a paralysis bomb, and the bomb itself should be a white orb which causes a low toned, ear-ringing sound on detonation.

* **R**: War Zone: [Channeled, Target Large Area, Long Cooldown, Large Mana Cost]

War Zone applies a visual effect to a large circle centered at a nearby location. While channeling, any enemy champion damaged in the area will receive an additional (60,80,100)% of Tyro's AD as physical damage. This additional damage is applied from the attacking unit, and can only give Tyro an assist.

Visually, war zone should be a large glowing field with an additional indicator for any enemy champion standing with its region. Tyro should also have a unique animation to indicate his channeling.
