**Atlencius, the Divine Sojourner**

---

**Info/Visuals**:

Atlencius is a semi-divine being whose origin is unknown. He is an average height, humonoid who wears a lucent body-mask and a fabric based armor to allow high mobility. Atlencius looks similar to the Noble Templar ( http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45834 ) and carries a similar weapon imbued with magical energies. Atlencius is a mana using, melee, ability power based champion whose powerful defensive abilities allow him to be a great top-lane champion.

**Abilities**:

**Innate**: Pulsar: Every sequential attack after the first on an enemy champion causes Atlencius' weapon to glow with fervor, increasing his attack range and movement speed by a small amount for 5 seconds, and stacking up to 5 times. While Atlencius has stacks of Pulsar he can left-click nearby enemy or allied units to dash to them, consuming pulsar. The maximum distance for which this effect applies increases with stacks of pulsar. If Atlencius attacks a new target, all stacks are lost.

*(Ideally, Atlencius' body mask should glow with increased stacks of Pulsar for visual effect)*

**Q**: Indomitable: Passive: Killing an enemy grants Atlencius a shield equal to a fraction of the dead target's maximum life (+10% AP). This shield lasts indefinitely, but is reset and overwritten if Atlencius kills a new unit whose provided shield would be greater than that currently available. Active: If no enemy champions are nearby, Atlencius' shield can be consumed for a movement speed boost equal to a flat amount (+10% AP) for a short time. (This ability is unavailable if enemy champions are within Atlencius' sight range or if he does not have his shield available, but otherwise has no cooldown).

**W**: Ballistic: Active: For 5 (+1% AP) seconds, all attacks knock their target back a short distance (this effect does not disjoint the affected enemy's actions).

*(Atlencius' attack animation should include a significantly deeper and more brutal strike sound when enabled)*

**E**: Mass: Active: Atlencius' next attack will deal 50 + (10% AP)*(1 + PulsarStackCount) bonus magic damage.

*(Mass should cause a flash of glowing effect whose vibrancy depends on pulsar stacks)*

**R**: Suspension: Active: When activated, the next champion to deal damage to Atlencius within melee range will be suppressed and suspended in the air for 4 (+1% AP) seconds. (This affect also suppresses Atlencius, similar to Malzahar's Nether Grasp). During the effect's duration, Atlencius also steals up to (30% AP) armor and magic resistance from the affected unit.

*(Visually, suspension should look like Atlencius is impaling the target on the end of his weapon in retalliation to the target's attack)*

**Explanation**:

Atlencius is designed to be an awesome top-lane champion due to the sustain provided by Indomitable, gank utility with Suspension (and ability to gank other lanes with Indomitable Active), and anti-gank ability with Ballistic, while still transitioning to an intense late-game dynamic.

Atlencius extreme damage with Pulsar and Mass paired with his assassinate and disengage ability provided by Pulsar's active, as well as his supportive peeling potential from Ballistic allow him to be extremely useful in all scenarios.

Useful items for Atlencius include Sorcerer's Boots, Mercury Treads, Ninja Tabi, Rabadon's Deathcap, Zhonya's Hourglass, Ruby Sightstone, Lich Bane, Liandry's Torment, Rylai's Crystal Scepter...
