**Verimah, the True Psychic**

**--**

**Lore**: During the initial onslaught of the league of legends ascending upon Azeroth, Kassadin's first target was [Kael, an Invoker](http://www.dota2wiki.com/wiki/Invoker) capable of summoning a vast multitude of abilities at will. Though Kassadin struck him down with minimal effort, he began to wonder how his power would transcend if he had similar opportunities. This curiosity led to bio-research, and soon after Verimah was born in a lab.

(Once again please excuse my poor lore-writing skills)

**Description**: Verimah is a complex champion - by far more confusing to use than anything else league of legends has, and potentially not much more powerful. Each of Verimah's Q,W,E, and R abilities contains a cycle of three abilities within, and these triples each share a cooldown. Verimah is heavily influenced by [Nehpilim, a hero in Eve of the Apocalypse](http://eota.emufarmers.com/wiki/Nephilim) who has 26 spells in total (5 sets of 5, plus an active innate). Verimah should look like [Mewtwo (lol)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Mewtwo.png) but hovering and with laser claws and huge muscles, or something equally as awesome. Verimah is a melee champion.

**Explanation**: Read this carefully: *Whenever an ability is cast by Verimah, all abilities cycle to the next one.* Although each of the three abilities within one nome is independent, they share a cooldown. This means that Verimah can burst in many ways:

QWER QWRE QEWR QERW QRWE QREW

WQER WQRE WEQR WERQ WRQE WREQ

EQWR EQRW EWQR EWRQ ERQW ERWQ

RQWE RQEW RWQE RWEQ REQW REWQ

... Plus each of these can begin with any of three from their cycle, therefore 72 different ways to nuke 4 abilities.

The next thing to understand is that each Nome has a cooldown:

Q: 5 seconds

W: 10 seconds

E: 3 seconds

R: 60 seconds

What this means is that after casting locking grasp/telepathy/leash, telepathy/leash/locking grasp will be unavailable for 3 seconds.

*But*, note his innate:

**--**

**Innate**: Casting an ability reduces all other cooldowns by 1 second.

**Q**: Nome of Force

-Locking Grasp - Verimah's next attack roots an enemy in place for 2/2.5/... seconds (40 mana, resets attack cooldown like nasus' Q, and many others)

-Telepathy - turns invisible, and moments later re-appears at target unit - ally or enemy (50 mana, 400/450/... range)

-Leash - target enemy is leashed, causing it to lose 10/20/...% attack speed while Verimah is near it. The effect persists as long as the two champions are alive and in range. Multiple leashes could, in theory, exist at once, but the effect does not stack. (70 mana, 400/450/... range)

**W**: Nome of Life

-Resonance Shield - shields a target ally for 3.5/4/... seconds. If the shield is broken it re-activates and jumps to a nearby ally (50 mana)

-Painsplit - Target ally will share all damage dealt to it with Verimah for 5/6/... seconds, such that whenever the target would receive damage, half of that will instead be deducted from Verimah's mana. (50 mana, 500/600/... range, 1 damage = 1/0.9/... mana)

-Divergent Future - Target ally is invulnerable and untargetable by target enemy for (4/5/...) seconds. The effect is canceled if target ally damages target enemy. (100 mana, 1000 range) *Note*: this ability must target an ally, then an enemy before any effect takes place.

**E**: Nome of Pain

-Swarm - Deals all enemies in a cone 50/60/... + 0.5*AP magic damage (40 mana, 600 range, PI/4 arc-size, not instant like kassadin/cho gath)

-Sap - skillshot which only hits champions, stops after initial strike - target enemy loses 40/50/... mana for every ability cast during the next 3/4/... seconds. For each loss, Veriham gains 20/25/... mana (600 range)

-Paralysis - Target area with radius 100 receives 10+0.6*AP magic damage after a delay of 0.5 seconds. Enemies hit by this effect receive 10/11/...% slow for 5/5.5/... seconds.

**R**: Nome of Domination

-Mindsplice - All enemies in a line are instantly feared for 1/1.5... seconds (800/900/... range, 100 radius, 100 mana, hitscan effect like Lux' laser)

-Execution - For 3/4/... seconds, Verimah and a target enemy unit become untargetable by allies/enemies while Verimah rapidly knocks back his target and blinks to its destination to repeat this process. This takes place in 3 dimensions in various directions around the local battlefield. At the end of the effect Verimah deals 200+AD+0.9*AP damage and stuns the target for 0.5/1/... seconds. (200 mana, 400 range)

-Alternate Dimension - All Enemies in a target area have their attack damage and ability power swapped for 4/5/... seconds. Additionally, their attack speed is inverted (2 attacks per second becomes 1 attack every 2 seconds) for 2/3/... seconds. (1000 range, 500/600/... radius, 200 mana)

**--**

Wrapping up, Verimah would make a powerful AP Mid or even support, with tons of utility and vastly varying spells, but with a potentially unreachable skill ceiling.

Please share your thoughts. Credit goes to DarnYak for single-handedly creating the most complex hero to ever be a realistic choice in a moba, and inspiring Verimah.
