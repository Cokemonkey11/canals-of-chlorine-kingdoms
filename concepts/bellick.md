Bellick, the Noxian Elder

Bellick is a Crippled old man with sunken eyes and a brown beard. He possesses the greatest magics from all of Noxia, and he is the father of Swain. Bellick has amputated lower legs and instead walks on prosthetics (like so: http://theconversation.edu.au/oscar-pistorius-and-the-olympics-good-news-or-bad-for-sport-8122). Bellick's only traditional weapon is his trusted Noxian dagger, which he rarely uses.

When Bellick attacks he uses psionics to release projectiles from his gloved hands.

Innate: Cybernetics: Bellick begins the game with a unique cybernetics item in his inventory which, when activated, cycles through various effects. Right clicking the item infuses it in his body and removes the ability to swap effects, but gains a power-up.

Cybernetics: Energix: In this form, nearby allies with less mana than Bellick gain doubled mana regeneration rate.
		* Un-infused only effect: leveling up with Energix enabled permanantly increases his ability power by 1.
		* Infused only effect: Bellick permanantly doubles his mana regeneration rate.
Cybernetics: Positrix: In this form, nearby allies gain increased attack rate for a brief period on kill.
		* Un-infused only effect: In this form, kills and assists permanantly increase his movement speed by 1.
		* Infused only effect: Bellick permanantly gains 15 movement speed.
Cybernetics: Detatrix:  In this form, nearby allies who take damage that would put them below 10% hit points gain a shield equal to 10% of their hit points. This can happen once in 60 seconds for each ally.
		* Un-infused only effect: If Bellick is attacked by a minion or neutral creep, the attacker's attack speed is reduced by 15% for 5 seconds.
		* Infused only effect: If an allied champion is attacked, it gains 20 armor and magic resistance for 5 seconds. This effect can only occur once in 30 seconds.


Q: Spider Mine: When Spider Mine comes off cooldown, Bellick burrows a spider mine underground. The spider mine will constantly move towards a fixed point 500 units in front of Bellick's facing direction. The spider mine has movement speed equal to twice that of Bellick's. On activation the spider mine explodes, knocking up enemy champions in its proximity.

W: Sonic Disjunction: Bellick emits a subsonic pulse in the  direction of a target ally, instantly disjointing any projectile that may be homing on them, and preventing them from taking damage for 1 second.

E: Paracitix: Bellick instantly marks all enemy champions in a line. If an ally damages a marked champion, they deal bonus damage. This ability has a very short cooldown

R: Mindwarp: Global (Channeled): Bellick begins channeling and creates a mirror image of any target allied champion, which appears beside him. While channeling, the mirror image persists and deals 50% damage and receiving 100% damage. If the mirror is invisible to enemy players, it gains double movement speed. The spell ends if the mirror image dies, Bellick stops channeling, or 60 seconds passes.
