**Lore**: Unlike Udyr, Elklantern was born in the jungle; he is a pure embodiment of forest life, and ruthlessly claims all of that territory to himself. Elklantern excels in keeping track of his territory and his enemies. It is said that he diverged from forest-life due to agitation in the natural regions of Summoner's Rift, but in reality his humanoid appearance and godlike qualities offer a quantum of doubt as to where he emerged from. (Please excuse me for writing terrible lore)

**Appearance**: Elklantern is a human looking character with dark skin and a crown of thorns resting on his head. His face is eyeless, with physique similar to that of Kassadin. His weapon is one of the two antlers that would have been from a 14-point elk.

**Abilities**:

**Innate Passive**: Cleansing Fear: When Elklantern receives damage that would kill him, the entire damage source is blocked, he is cleansed of all debuffs, and all enemies in melee range are feared for 1 second. This effect can only occur once in (60-championLevel) seconds.

**Q**: Impaling Trap/Placement:

Type: Conditional Switch: Non-Target/Target Unit

Cost: 90/100/... mana

Cooldown: Complex

Description: On first cast, Elklantern channels for 5 seconds to place an impaling trap at his location. This can be interrupted, at which point the spell has a 30 second cooldown. When activated, the trap impales all enemies in melee range upward for a brief duration, who are then slowed for 2/3/... seconds, and the object persists for 5 seconds. This trap is visible but invulnerable, with very low sight range. Lasts 180 seconds. While active, Elklantern's Q ability is replaced with "Placement":

Cost: 30/40/... mana

Cooldown: 10/9/... seconds

Range: 400

Description: Elklantern dashes to an allied unit, champion, or object rapidly. If the target is an Impaling Trap, the casting range is multiplied by 2/2.5/... If an Impaling Trap activates, this cooldown is instantly refreshed.

**W**: Arms Competence:

Type: Non-Target Cycle

Cost: 50/45/... mana

Cooldown: 1 second

Description: Elklantern cycles through three different attacking methods, in the pattern (a,b,c,a,...)

Method a: Slashing: Elklantern strikes a single target, dealing standard damage with a 6/8/...% passive life-steal on attack.

Method b: Sweeping: Elklantern strikes a single target, dealing standard damage and 10/20/...% area of effect damage on attack.

Method c: Stabbing: Elklantern strikes a single target, dealing double damage at half attack speed and granting 50% armor penetration.

**E**: Companion:

Type: Passive + Global Area Target Ground

Cost: 100/110/... mana

Range: 3000/4000/...

Area: 1000/1500/... diameter

Cooldown: 30/29/... seconds

Description: When the companion ability is acquired, Elklantern summons his familiar, a faerie, to follow him. The faerie is untargetable and cannot attack, but, due to its flying nature, can see over walls with half the range of a normal champion. When activated, the faerie temporarily stops following Elklantern, and instead channels for 5/10/... seconds, granting Elklantern and his team mates vision of all neutral minions in a targeted area.

**R**: Tracking:

Type: Switch - Two passive effects.

Cost: 0 mana

Cooldown: 5/4/... seconds

Description: Using tracking switches between two passive effects, in the pattern (a,b,a,...)

Effect A: Elklantern's vision is passively increased by 25/35/...% in his facing direction. Units attacked by him are dealt minor bleed DoT and revealed for 8/9/... seconds.

Effect B: Elklantern begins to bleed passively once per second, and his god-like blood remains on the surface where he has walked for 10/15/... seconds. Enemies can see this blood, but Elklantern has vision of this area as well. Additionally, standing near his own blood grants an attack speed increase, calculated by the number of blood pools nearby, where 5 blood pools grants (15+7.5+5+...+(15/5))% attack speed.

(General Equation of effect B: sum from n=1 to p of (15/n) where p is the number of blood pools nearby)

**--**

**Playstyle**: Elklantern is an AD hero, useful as a solo top or jungler, and a very good counter-jungler. His abilities give him a lot of utility, but only decent survivability and gap-closing ability.
