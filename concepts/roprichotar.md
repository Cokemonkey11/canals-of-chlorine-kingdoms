**Name**

> Roprichoctar, The Steel Bender

**Intended Role**

> Fighter, Bruiser

**Appearance**

> Roprichoctar is a robot with a humanoid upper half, carrying a large battle hammer, and a wide, tank-shaped lower half with tank treads. It has a large hitbox size. With high movespeed, his move animation shifts from rolling on treads to using his enormous hammer to carry momentum and "bound" off it (def: walk or run with leaping strides)

**Background**

> Blades and Guns are ineffective against robots, but battle hammers do the job nicely, impaling large sections of vital android structure. Roprichoctar was literally designed to terminate organic structures and machinery with equal ease. It is made of composite armor featuring concrete, steel, and organic (dirt) armor layers, making blades and hammers equally useless in battle.

**Important Note**

> Roprichoctar uses a resource called EIC (Electronic Ion Concentration) in place of mana or energy. EIC is a cheap, efficient resource which obeys some simple properties:

> * Maximum EIC of 500 at any time

> * EIC is regenerated while moving, at a rate of 1 EIC per 1 game unit (Note that 500 EIC can therefore be regenerated in a matter of seconds, with typical base movement speeds around 330)

**Passve** - Electromagnetism

> Nearby enemy champions within Roprichoctar's EIC's range (maximum of 500) have their movement and attackspeed reduced by 10% passively.

**Q** - Portside Blows (Instant Cast)

> Roprichoctar swings his mighty hammer in the reverse direction, resetting his attack cooldown and dealing X additional damage on the next attack (similar to Nasus Q in behavior); Portside blows can store up to 3 stacks and regenerate once per 5 seconds. Cost 100 EIC.

**W** - Flexor (Target Cast)

> Roprichoctar grabs a target champion within short range and suppresses it for a short time. While suppressing a target, his W' ability, Tensor (Location Cast) is available. (Cost 100 EIC) (Medium Cooldown)

> > Tensor targets a location which is essentially just an angle from his suppressed target. On cast, Roprichoctar dashes to the targeted angle without ending suppression. (Cost 100 EIC)

**E** - Geometric Inversion (Instant Cast)

> Roprichoctar instantly summons an organic shield from his decomposed materials, which blocks up to (Roprichoctar's Missing health * EIC/500) damage, and lasting 5 seconds. (Cost all available EIC) (Long Cooldown)

**R** - Terminus (Instant Cast)

> Roprichoctar transforms into a full-size tank, increasing his size and hitbox tremendously. In this state, 100% of his MR is converted to armor, his health increases by 500, his range increases by 650, his attacks deal damage to all enemies in a line, and 10% of his attack damage is converted to true damage. Portside Blows, Flexor, and Geometric Inversion are unavailable in this state. Terminus can be canceled early by casting R a second time. (Cost 500 EIC) (Very Long Cooldown)
