**Name:** Kyl, the Whirling Satyr

**Intended Role:**

> Primary: Bruiser, Secondary: Fighter, Duelist

**Background:**

> (This is very imaginitive, and infringes copyrights, so I obviously don't expect it to be used by Riot) A great darkness came over Azeroth when the burning legion of undead arrived to purge the world of organic life. The orcs were the first to join sides with the Demon lord, for the destruction of the humans is a desirable feat regardless of consequences. Satyrs, although not inherently evil, are cunning and often malicious. The satyrs would want nothing more than their forests to be protected, but the imminent disaster made it obvious that human life in Azeroth will soon cease to be, so Kyl led his people to side with the Orcs and Undead.

> Kyl and his Satyrs soon became possessed by the will of the Burning Legion, and their desire for battle grew. Kyl received favor from the demon lord for his skill with a scythe, and his powers grew immensely.

> Kyl was sent with a battallion of skeletons on a culling of a nearby dalaran city, and was cursed by the demon lord with a magic that promised to teleport him home in the case of death. Unbeknownst to Kyl, something vile happened that day, and his dark energy consumed the curse and Kyl was never the same. Still, a demon lord's curse is not something whose effect can cease so easily.

> In battle Kyl was met by an Archmage of immense power, significantly stronger than anything the humans ever had before. From the Archmage flowed tidal waves, massive in volume, that decimated his battallion by the hundreds. For a moment Kyl had a fear that perhaps the humans were not so weak after all, and he led his people to certain darkness for no reason. But the darkness inside him consumed his fear and an adrenal rampage made Kyl as ferocious as lightning and he sprung at the Archmage, dodging fireballs and slicing at him. In one clean stroke, the horse the Archmage mounted became paraplegic and the Archmage was suddenly on foot.

> The archmage banished Kyl temporarily to the Ethereal world where his scythe served no purpose, and, sensing imminent defeat, the Archmage began channeling a powerful arcane magic which would send Kyl away from battle. Kyl's existance finally shifted back to the organic world, and he lunged at the Archmage. The archmage finished his channeling, and in one final strike, exerted ball lightning at Kyl with all his remaining energy. Just then Kyl and his battallion were teleported away--the ball lightning exploded, obliterating him into ash.

> Something happened between the dueling magics of the Archmage's teleportation and the Demon Lord, and Kyl was sent through the multiverse and ended up in Runeterra. Kyl doesn't have any memories of such events, but his skills with a Scythe are still there, and occasionally the powers of the dark and light forces swell inside of him...

**Abilities:**

Passive: Genocide

> Whenever Kyl deals a killing blow on an enemy champion, he goes on a rampage, dealing 100% AD in an AoE (3 teemos) around the target, and gaining 10 AD and 10 MS for 30 seconds. This effect stacks indefinitely. Visually his scythe should extend with some laser effect to represent AoE damage.

Q: Gigaslash (50/70/90 mana, 10/8/6 second cooldown)

> Kyl's next attack deals true damage. This ability resets his attack animation (Like Nasus Q) If Gigaslash deals a killing blow, Kyl gains 1 armor for 30 seconds, stacking indefinitely.

W: Black Arts (60/70/80 mana, 12/10/8 second cooldown)

> Passive: Every 6th attack Kyl deals blinds the target for 1 attack (maximum 5 seconds)

> Active: Kyl resets all cooldowns (besides Black Arts) This effect has a standard cast animation time.

E: Whirling (30/40/50 mana, 8/6/4 second cooldown)

> Kyl instantly whirls his scythe around, dealing 60% AD (+1% for each 2% health missing from the affected unit) to all enemies around him. This ability has a standard cast animation time.

R: Page Swap (No mana cost, no cooldown)

> Page swap is not an ability. It simply rotates Q, W, E -> Q', W', E', his second set of abilities. Page swap doesn't interrupt movement, can be cast continuously, and costs ntohing. Page swap can't be leveled up, and is available to Kyl at level 1. Additionally, abilities are leveled up independently, which means that leveling up Q does not affect Q'. Lastly, Kyl has a two-level skip requirement for each ability, which means that if Kyl acquires Q at level 1, he can't upgrade Q again until level 4.

Q': Shadow Stance (30/40/50 mana, 14/12/10 second cooldown)

> Kyl instantly turns invisible for (0.25,0.5,0.75) seconds, disjointing all projectiles (like Vladamir W) and preventing him from taking damage.

W': Switchbang (80/100/120 mana, 14/12/10 second cooldown)

> Switchbang is a uniquely targeted ability which can be described as "target a unit with direction" - it means that Kyl will dash a short distance to the enemy champion he targets, but will appear at the side of the champion which was clicked (eg clicking slightly behind the enemy champion will dash behind him). After dashing, the next attack to the target within 2 seconds will knock it back a short distance.

E': Ritual (50/40/30 mana & 10% HP, 30/28/26 second cooldown)

> Ritual sacrifices up to 10% of Kyl's maximum HP to produce a shield equal to double that value for (10/12/14) seconds. Ritual cannot kill Kyl.

**Appearance:**

> Kyl is a Satyr (Humanoid with fur and fangs which specializes in Scythe combat and dark magic) who glows dark energy and wields a scythe as a weapon. His speech is generally mammal/lion-like, and often it turns to a demonic growl unintentionally.

**Design Discussion:**

**Five sentence summary:**

> Kyl is a highly micro-oriented/skill-based fighter designed to duel with champions like Jax, Fiora, and Riven in a solo lane. His unique ability set and style promises an intense mid-game with plenty of room for making plays. Kyl has the potential to carry games with his reset-like behaviour of his W and innate abilities. He has the ability to rapidly displace key opponents and survive using Q', W', and E'. He also has the ability to compete with junglers like Rengar with his fast jungle clearing and his ability to 100-0 someone (Q, W, and E).

**Playing Kyl:**

> Kyl is designed to have a less than obvious ability-path. there is not supposed to be an idael set of spells to have at, for example, level 4, and Kyl should be fairly versatile against different kinds of matchups. When jungling I recommend W, E, and W' early, and when playing solo against AP champions I recommend Q', Q, and W' early.

**Stats:**

Health: Medium (similar to rengar)

Mana: Medium (Similar to Jax)

Range: 140 (Big melee)

Attack Damage: Medium/High (Similar to Jax)

Attack Speed: Medium (Similar to Riven)

Armor/MR: Medium (Standard melee Fighter)

Move-Speed: Medium (Similar to Jax)

**Quotes:**

**Joke:**

"As you wish, lord of darkness.. I mean, summoner."

"Eenie, meenie, miney, moe - we'll kill them all, and then go home."

**Taunt:**

"You brought *that* to fight *me*? Ha! HAHAH:LAJfaoisuaoisfo;sjd;ksdg" (becomes demonic nonsense)

**Special Interaction after killing Rengar**

"Pussy."
