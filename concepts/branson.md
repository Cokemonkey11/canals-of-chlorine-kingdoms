**Branson, the Ex-Apprentice**

>Lore:

Branson was the young apprentice of Professor Stanwick, the inventor who stole the design for blitzcrank. Branson believed in Stanwick, who boasted about his capabilities and power, ensuring that some day Branson would learn all that could be taught, and become powerful beyond his imagination. When Branson discovered the source of Stanwick's brand new robot, stolen from Viktor, he lost trust in his master. He began questioning why Stanwick was delaying his teachings, and inquiring about the source of every little device Stanwick would come up with. As he learned how Stanwick lies, he gradually lost his patience. Stanwick wasted his life, and he wanted revenge; he went off on his own, researching for the only invention he would ever need: The perfect murder weapon. In secret, Branson developed the acid blade.

It was pouring rain on an autumn night, and Branson stepped in from the cold. Stanwick with his back to him:

"Branson, what are you doing here so late? I'm... working on something..."

"Professor, I was hoping you could take a look at my latest device, I value your approval." he said, his heart slamming in his throat, the sour taste of death on his tongue.

"A device?... Not now, Bran--"

The 15 year old Branson cut Stanwick in half from his shoulder blade to his hip, the acid penetrating Stanwick's flesh and metal, ensuring he could never breathe again. With the stench of sulfur filling the room, Branson made haste in taking the only thing Stanwick had that he could really want: a jetbike.



> Physical Appearance:

Take http://i.imgur.com/Uq9jGI3.jpg, remove the helmet. His bike is clean and shiny, but floats in the same way. Shorten the jetbike nose (keep champion model closer to circular, looks better in LoL). Branson carries a sword in his right hand that drips green slime as he rides; blade usually held slightly outstretched, think like http://i.imgur.com/o6ygAvV.jpg. Blade should fling acid whenever he strikes, and drips on the ground should match the sword (including when he attacks), which would leave a cool pattern as he traverses the battlefield. His face should have a young, posh British look like [Henry Hopper](http://i.imgur.com/g0h6fFg.jpg) (the kind of guy Viktor and professor Stanwick should hate)



> Appearance Design:

Being young and fragile, Branson is highly reliant on his jetbike - it provides all his abilities other than living blade, which he built himself. Branson relies on his intelligence and savagery to even exist in the league of legends, since his wisdom and physical strength don't come close to the status quo.



> Base Stats:

Branson has low base health, health per second, armor, and magic resist for a melee champion, similar to Zed or Riven. Branson has decent movespeed and base damage, with excellent damage scaling.



> Abilities:

Innate: Corrosion: Whenever Branson activates an ability, his jetbike additionally releases a burst of acid; nearby enemies are slowed by 20% for 0.75 seconds and receive a stack of corrosion, reducing their armor by 2. Corrosion stacks lasts 8 seconds and can stack up to 10 times. Range: 280

Q: Living Blade: On activation, causes Branson's next basic attack to provide 60/70/80/90/100 % bonus life steal, additionally resetting the auto-attack animation. 13/11.5/10/8.5/7 second cooldown. Costs 40 mana.

W: Nuclear Drive: Toggle: When enabled, Branson drains 20 mana per second, dealing 40% Bonus AD damage per second to nearby enemies, as well as increasing movement speed and tenacity by 10%. Cooldown: 10/9/8/7/6

E: Revboost: Passively gains a stack every 11/10/9/8/7 seconds which can be consumed to dash a short distance (400 range) towards the cursor. After activating revboost, Branson's next attack in the next 10 seconds will instead fire a ranged plasma round from his jetbike (+300 range, + 80% bonus AD) Costs 50 mana.

R: Ion Inversion: Branson channels for up to 1.5 seconds before his jetbike launches a wave of ionic energy in the target direction (cone with 30 degree arc, 900 range). Ion Inversion's projectile speed is proportional to his channeling time (500 + 1500 * channelTime), and affected targets are dealt 70/90/110 (+ 100% AD) (+1% for each 1% target health missing) (+5% for every stack of corrosion) physical damage. Costs 150 mana, Cooldown: 110/80/50



> Design Reasoning:

Plain and simple, Branson is another ridiculous fighter/playmaker designed to duel with other fighters and outscale bruisers. Branson's utility allows him to accel in the jungle, and chase fleeing targets. His aoe ability components give him devastating team fight power. His primary weakness is mana, which makes building him a concern due to his huge AD scaling.

Branson's kit is simple on the outside (and probably could use some refinement), but has a lot of subtle nuances. Understanding how long to channel Ion Inversion is the difference between landing it and failing completely. Stacking corrosion efficiently means taking advantage of the non-stacking slow without giving up stacks for Ion Inversion. Branson is team-composition reliant due to his lack of hard CC, but otherwise excels in all aspects for today's jungle meta.
